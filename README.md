##  Overview  
**WriteTrack** is an interactive web application designed to help students stay on track with their assignments and coursework.  
As users complete each requirement on the rubric, WriteTrack automatically checks off the corresponding tasks and provides **real-time visual feedback** to show overall progress.

The goal of this project is to make learning support more **interactive, accessible, and motivating**. It connects students with Writing Center principles and peer collaboration by turning assignment rubrics into actionable, visual progress tools.  
Originally designed in **Figma**, WriteTrack was implemented as a **responsive, lightweight website** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
